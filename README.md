Heyo! currently in university studying comp sci, but I've also had more than a few years experience in Python, C++ and assembly language (Specifically x86 assembly).
Not really sure what I want to progress in directly, so I work on a range of stuff from rendering engines to pixel art software to machine emulation.
If you found my github, it won't be too difficult to find my other socials lol

If you're curious about stuff, drop me a message, I'll respond eventually!

Pronouns are He/Him :)
